Naive Bayes classifier is the fast, accurate and reliable algorithm. Naive Bayes classifiers have high accuracy and speed on large datasets.\n","\n","As the name suggested Naive Bayes is based on **Bayes Theorem**. It assumes that the effect of a particular feature in a class is independent of other features. For example, a loan applicant is desirable or not depending on his/her income, previous loan and transaction history, age, and location. Even if these features are interdependent, these features are still considered independently. This assumption simplifies computation, and that's why it is considered as **naive.**\n","\n","To understand math behind this algorithm check out this video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS1CKhALUBQ\">Naive Bayes</a>\n","\n","So here it is important to know what is Bayes theorem. \n","Bayes’ Theorem provides a way that we can calculate the probability of a piece of data belonging to a given class, given our prior knowledge. Bayes’ Theorem is stated as:\n","\n","\n","**P(class|data) = (P(data|class) * P(class)) / P(data)**\n","\n","Where P(class|data) is the probability of class given the provided data.\n","\n","    Lets get started with Naive Bayes.
